# functionality
- memorize ranges
- define, visualize, and store ranges

# what is a range
- range is defined as a set of actions and the frequency those actions are performed per hand, after a given history of gameplay
- various actions should be available to users, but only one fold, one call, and one all-in should be available. raises of various sizes can be made available, and each of these raises can be given an annotation or label, i.e. (overbet, 3bet, etc.)

# how to memorize/quiz one on a range
- these ranges should be presented to the user to be learned either one at a time or multiple at a time, and there should be multiple ways to quiz the user on these ranges
- users should be presented with a specific hand from the range and asked the frequency of actions for that hand
- users can be presented with the entire range and asked to draw the range out, i.e. provide the action breakdown for each hand
- users can be presented with a specific 3x3 square of the range that is critical and asked to draw out the range, like in the previous line
